                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Yoshua, a student at Fontys. I was from Aruba and currently pursuing my passion for ICT. My academic journey 
                        started at Colegio San Nicolas (now called Colegio Nigel Matthews), where I completed HAVO, the Dutch 
                        equivalent of high school I guess. My interest in computers began back in MAVO, and by the time I 
                        reached HAVO, I knew this was the path I wanted to follow. ICT was the only subject that genuinely 
                        sparked my curiosity and kept me motivated to learn more. <br>

                        Outside of school, I enjoy playing games, hitting the gym, and drawing (even if I’m not the best at it). 
                        I’m proud to say I’ve already lost over 20kg since last year, and I’m still working on my fitness goals. 
                        Drawing is more of a fun hobby for something I do to relax and let my creativity flow.</p>

                <div class="about-me-skills">
                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p>I’ve been diving into programming languages like JavaScript and C++. While I’m learning JavaScript at 
                    school, I’ve taken the initiative to explore C++ on my own, especially for game development. It’s been a 
                    fun challenge to brainstorm ideas I have in that path for the future. Recently, I’ve also been learning 
                    Blender, where I made this smelly looking environment you are exploring. Even though it was tough to pick up at first, 
                    I’ve grown to really enjoy it and love how much I can create with it. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-me-goals">
                    <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
                    <p>Looking ahead, I’m determined to build a successful life doing something I enjoy. Right now, 
                        I’m considering a career in cybersecurity as it’s practical and in demand, really in it for the dough, 
                        but I also find game development way more exciting. If neither of those paths works out, I can see myself thriving in 
                        front-end development or even becoming a full-stack developer with more experience. Whatever direction I take, 
                        I aim to be someone my team can always rely on. I may not be the best in my field, but I’ll work hard to make 
                        sure everything runs smoothly and that I contribute to the success of the team. </p>
