                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>BLIK is a group of women who want to express what playback theatre is and the way my group and I will have to 
                        do this is by creating a brand identity for them. The brand identity will be used to promote the group and 
                        their performances. From here I will explain the work I did for the group and the process of my parts in creating the brand identity.</p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>This project involved creating a brand identity for BLIK Playback Theatre by targeting HR professionals, event organizers, and private clients as Blik's target audience. 
                        To get the data collection process started I conducted a <span class="clickable-word" data-target="survey-content">survey</span> to get a better understanding of what the target audience would like to see in this brand identity.
                        A <span class="clickable-word" data-target="competitor-analysis-content">competitor analysis</span> followed, comparing similar playback theatre groups in terms of their social media presence, engagement, and website functionality. 
                        The findings were compiled into a model on <span class="clickable-word" data-target="competitor-analysis-model-content">Figma</span> for reference in the brand guide.
                    </p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>At first, I had questions made on Google Forms but after some feedback I changed the questions asked to fit better for the target group of companies, event organizers and 
                            private individuals. Also, the structure on how the survey should be answered as at first majority of the questions would needed to be answered openly as I was assuming 
                            that the answers were be more descriptive than a simple one to two word answer because I was first aiming to theatre enjoyers as the target group. From then on I 
                            switched to google forms to make more multiple choice questions, and likert scale type questions, to have the survey takers be more engaged with simple clicks and images. </p>
                        <p><strong>Target Demographic:</strong>  The target audience is mainly 25-35-year-olds, with a large portion working as finance officers.<br>
                            <strong>Familiarity with Playback Theatre:</strong>  Most respondents were unfamiliar with Playback Theatre, underscoring the need for content that explains the concept clearly and emphasizes its benefits to potential clients. <br>
                            <strong>Content Strategy:</strong>  The preferred content types are highlight reels, behind-the-scenes content, and promotions for upcoming events. These will form the core of the client’s social media strategy, with a recommended posting frequency of twice a week for optimal engagement. <br>
                            <strong>Visual and Website Preferences:</strong>  Respondents favored website content that includes show details, booking rates, and the group’s mission and values. They preferred imagery of emotional moments from performances and group photos of actors interacting with the audience, reflecting the essence of Playback Theatre. <br>
                            <strong>Colors and Fonts:</strong>  Dark, moody colors were associated with deep emotions, though it would be better to align color and font choices with the client’s core values. <br>
                            <strong>Booking Motivations:</strong>  Emotional impact and team-building benefits were identified as the primary factors influencing booking decisions. <br>
                            <strong>Social Media Preferences:</strong>  Instagram and Facebook are the most used platforms by the target audience. Posts will be scheduled for evenings when engagement is highest, focusing on these two platforms. <br>

                        <p>Like mentioned before, I looked onto these theatre groups as they also work on playback theatre and they are few of the mentioned groups we can look into by Blik. 
                            This is the summary of the findings I have made on the groups and how they are doing on social media and their websites. </p>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Theater Draad</strong> <br>
                        Theater Draad primarily uses Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, but they have an irregular posting schedule with updates every 1-3 months. Their social media content mainly features group photos, performance setups, and event announcements without a consistent color scheme or visual identity. Audience engagement is minimal, with only occasional likes on comments and little direct interaction.
                        Their website is functional, mobile-responsive, and easy to navigate, offering features such as event details, a performance request form, and a newsletter sign-up. However, the overall design lacks a distinctive appeal.</p>
                        <p> <strong>TTA (Terugspeeltheater Amsterdam)</strong> <br>
                            TTA's social media presence includes Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, but they post inconsistently, often skipping months. Their content consists of group photos, inspirational quotes, and performance updates, yet lacks a unified visual identity. While audience interaction is low, they do respond to comments on Facebook.
                            Their website has a bland design with a white background and minimal imagery. Though mobile-responsive and functional, it lacks engaging visuals and has broken links. There is no contact form, only social media links and an email for bookings.</p>
                        <p> <strong>International Playback Theatre Network (IPTN)</strong> <br>
                            IPTN maintains a stronger social media presence on Instagram and Facebook, with posts every 1-2 months. Their content includes group photos, performance updates, event visuals, and interactive posts like surveys, with a consistent color scheme of blue and beige. They engage well with their audience, frequently responding to comments and promoting donation campaigns.
                            Their website is visually appealing, well-organized, and easy to navigate. It effectively communicates the group’s mission and offers clear explanations of Playback Theatre, with pages dedicated to upcoming events and donation options.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>I created a model in Figma for the visual appeal of the competitor analysis to present key insights in a clear and visually engaging manner. This approach was 
                            essential because it allowed me to highlight patterns and differences in competitors’ social media strategies, branding consistency, and online presence at a glance. By using 
                            a visual format, I was able to condense all the gathered data into an easily digestible reference, making it more effective for decision-making during the branding process.</p>
                            <p>The importance of this model lies in its ability to streamline the comparison of strengths and weaknesses across multiple competitors. It ensured that BLIK's branding strategy
                                 could be tailored to address gaps in the market while adopting practices that competitors had successfully implemented. Additionally, presenting the analysis visually made it
                                  easier for stakeholders to quickly grasp key findings and contribute to discussions on brand identity and content strategy.</p>

                    To complement the survey data, a one-on-one <span class="clickable-word" data-target="interview-content">interview</span> was conducted with an event organizer, Eveline, who offered deeper insight into the needs and challenges of BLIK’s primary audience. 
                    Her feedback on website design, color schemes, and fonts played a pivotal role in refining the brand’s identity. The interview was recorded with Eveline's permission and with powerpoint slides, 
                    to be more clear with the questions i'm asking towards her. After analyzing the survey results, competitor analysis and interview, 
                    I created a <span class="clickable-word" data-target="businessplan-content">business plan</span> on the content strategy and visual identity to how Blik should represent themselves to their target audience.

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The interview with Eveline was crucial for gaining insights into BLIK’s potential audience, brand perception, and event planning dynamics. By engaging directly with a professional who regularly organizes events 
                            and manages teams, the interview offered nuanced feedback that can guide BLIK in refining its offerings and improving its communication strategy. Eveline’s responses revealed valuable information about the importance of emotional engagement, 
                            creativity, and team-building in event planning, confirming that Playback Theatre could be a fitting option for the types of events she organizes.</p>
                        <p>Her candid feedback on BLIK’s website highlighted a critical area for improvement. While the design and colors were appealing, the homepage did not immediately convey that BLIK is a theatre group. This insight is significant, as first impressions are vital in attracting new clients.
                             Additionally, Eveline’s preference for warm tones and an artistic font provided helpful guidance for aligning BLIK’s visual identity with its core values, ensuring consistency in its branding.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the interview underscored the need for clearer messaging, targeted outreach to event planners, and thoughtful design choices that emphasize BLIK’s unique approach to performance and engagement. 
                            Through this process, BLIK can better meet the expectations of its target audience and overcome potential barriers to booking performances.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The business plan for Blik Playback Theatre Group emphasizes the importance of establishing a strong online presence to address the group's current lack of visibility and 
                            accessibility for potential clients, such as HR professionals, event organizers, and private individuals. By creating a cohesive brand identity rooted in core values like 
                            reflection, playfulness, vulnerability, and connection, the plan aims to position Blik as a unique provider of emotionally impactful and team-building experiences.</p>
                        <p>Central to the strategy is the development of a professional, user-friendly website and the launch of social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn). These tools
                             are designed to communicate Blik's mission, showcase its performances, and provide an accessible booking system. The branding strategy incorporates a green-focused color palette
                              symbolizing growth and balance, paired with consistent visuals and messaging to foster recognition and engagement.</p>
                        <p>The plan underscores the importance of engaging content, including performance highlights, behind-the-scenes glimpses, and interactive posts, tailored to the preferences of Blik's 
                            target demographic. Insights from surveys and interviews guided the selection of posting schedules, platforms, and website features, ensuring alignment with audience expectations.</p>
                            <p>This approach not only addresses the visibility challenges but also differentiates Blik from competitors by focusing on brand consistency, high-quality visuals, and enhanced 
                                audience interaction. The business plan is a critical step in building awareness, driving bookings, and solidifying Blik's position as a leading Playback Theatre group.</p>

                    Following up with the whole business plan on the content strategy for the social media platforms, I created <span class="clickable-word" data-target="mockup-content">mockups</span> to guide the 
                    creation and distribution of engaging posts that align with Blik's brand identity and resonate with its target audience. With some photoshop touchups to get rid of some details, I finishe the mockups 
                    in Figma. Though it was not my task, time was running out and I had to help with the <span class="clickable-word" data-target="website-prototype-content">website prototype.</span></p>

                        <p>The template of the Instagram home screen was taken from Google images. In photoshop I made changes to mostly erase unneeded areas of the template so then I can continue with 
                            simpler changes in Figma. After some more feedback from my group, with placement and color, the mockups were finished. I came up with the last minute "crazy" idea to add paint 
                            splashes to the posts as it makes sense with creativeness and Blik cans to be like pain cans. This idea stuck to be part of the brand guide as something that fits with Blik's 
                            brand identity. After the first mockup, I wanted to make another one based on adding a new member to Blik's group as they have mentioned before, and asked, about the details needed 
                            if Blik wanted to recruit a new member. A paint splash was set as the green circle as a simple post that highlights the key words on what the post is about. </p>

                        <p> Like mentioned before, the website prototyping was not my task but I needed to help finish it up as it was a last minute effort. I worked on making a prototype of the Blik member 
                            recruitement page and the booking page. I made sure the header, footer, colors and fonts that all fit with the brand identity we all agreed upon. Since this was a last minute effort, 
                        not much could be really worked on again on this for feedback. </p>

                    <p>This being the first project with the group I have to stick with the entire semester was bad. Two members who are struggling/no idea what to do for thier one given task the entire sprint 
                        was worrying. I am somewhat satisfied with the work I have done for the group but I am not happy with the group as a whole. I am glad Blik did like a lot of the work that was done. 
                        This is the point where I needed to work more on my presentation skills as I was not able to present the work without having to read most of it on the screen.
