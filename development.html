                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This project is a continuation of the media campaign project as me and my group member work with 
                        Monk again, this time to develop a website. The idea is to redesign the page where customers view 
                        the climbing shoes and it is up to me and my group member on how we will tackle important features 
                        and design.</p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>There was no need for much introduction for this project. I already know about Monk. The only 
                        deal was to think how this web page will have to be redesigned. The Figma look on the webshop 
                        mockup was reused and new things came in addition to make the full on <span class="clickable-word" data-target="high-fidelity-prototype-content">high-fidelity prototype</span>. 
                        The Built For You message sticks with the project. The clear solution is a shoe filter system and 
                        shoe picker. With another email written for <span class="clickable-word" data-target="client-communication-content">client communication</span> with Monk, I got what I needed for the shoe filter 
                        system. That being color, aggression, brand specific size, material, way to show experience level, 
                        etc.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="high-fidelity-prototype-content" class="project-txt-and-img">

                    <div class="text">
                        <p> The high-fidelity prototype is the extension of the webshop mockup from the media campaign project,
                           to which I worked specifally on the shoe size guides (excluding the results), the shopping cart page 
                           and checkout page. The shoe size guide was taken inspiration from the klimschoenen calculate 
                           climbing shoe size page. 
                        </p>
                        <p>It was always supposed to go from getting the user's size via the text box, then to the foot width, the 
                            foot shape, the brand of shoe, experience level and finally the results. Due to time crunch, I was not 
                            the one who did the changes of color and extra stuff to these pages but was present on getting 
                            the feedback needed to make the changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>The shopping cart page was mostly taken reference from Bol and Amazon's shopping cart pages 
                            where the items are displayed with it's quantity and price. The checkout page was taken reference by 
                            the Monkshop's checkout page. The only difference is that the checkout page I prototyped had some 
                            difference in design with rounder borders than the original. The checkout page is here as content that 
                            was left out in the end, as it did not make it into the final product.

                        <p>The shoe guide, next to the filtering system, were essential to this project in my mind. 
                            Before I could start on the shoe guide, I had to get the specifics of each shoe Monk offers. I 
                            sent an email to Bob from Monk to ask him what are the specifics of climbing shoes that customers 
                            should have to look into before buying. Since Monk likes us more than other groups, we got our reply 
                            with the specifics I will have to look into for each shoe in the Monkshop. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I will talk more on finding the shoe specifics on the excel part but this was a mess. These are the 
                            most important details of a shoe Monk themselves say that customers should look into even though 
                            their own webshop does not have it. I had to go to many many different websites to get all the information 
                            I needed for these shoes. Bergfreunde is a very good example of a website that has all the information 
                            with nice looking pictures and art, most importantly the details of the shoe. No funny busniness, just 
                            straight to the point if this shoe is vegan or not, how aggressive it is with the downturn, the closure type,
                            etc. With more time I would have wanted to recreate this kind of showcase of information for the Monkshop.

                    <p>Using the <span class="clickable-word" data-target="moscow-content">MoSCoW method</span>, me and my group member made it clear to what must, should, could and 
                        wonâ€™t be on the webshop. I went on to write the shoe filer specifics for each shoe that Monk offers 
                        in the Monkshop. I started first writing it in Notepad but then changed to <span class="clickable-word" data-target="excel-content">Excel</span> to make things easier 
                        when I need the code to read the amount of data I have. This process went on through different sites 
                        as Monk does not offer all the important information for each shoe. Most notably I had to go to any 
                        website that sells the same shoe and take the written information on the filter specifics I am missing. 
                        Coding the webshop was split in two parts. My group member worked on the front-end side while I work on 
                        the <span class="clickable-word" data-target="backend-content">back-end</span> side of the coding. </p>

                        <p>Me and my group member brainstormed on features to add to the final product, aside of 
                            the filtering system as it was already decided. After equally writing down what we think we 
                            want for the features of the website, we did a MoSCoW method to decide what must, should, could and won't be 
                            on the website. This was to set priorities to the work that needs to be done.
                        </p>
                        <p>Features that belong on the must have will be the ones that need to be done and implimented in the website before 
                            everything else. Than it comes down to the sould have features that are important but not as important as the musts.
                            The could haves are features that are nice to have but not necessary. The won't haves are features that are not going to be 
                            on the website at all as they are not important to the website, and doing a 3d model of each shoe would take insane amount of 
                            time for me to do along side all the back-end work.

                        <p>This was an adventure and a half. I first started writing all the shoes one by one in Notepad that 
                            belong to the Monkshop. I had to write down the specifics of each shoe that Monk offers. Of course 
                            I had to go to different websites to get the information I needed for each shoe that is not 
                            on the Monkshop. I then thought that doing this in Excel would be easier for me to read the data back 
                            in VSCode when importing the csv file. It wasn't so easy copy pasting what I had written down in Notepad 
                            into Excel. There were some problems with text not coming out right. I had to then rewrite everything but 
                            in Excel this time. Finally after writing all the details of each show in Excel, I tried the csv file reading 
                            in VSCode. It wasn't a success. The description of the shoe was not coming out right. After several attempts I then 
                            scrap the idea of reading the csv file in VSCode and use the Notepad content as the data to insert into the database 
                            with SQLite3. I had written all the shoes in notepad inside brackets, quotes and commas so it passes through fine. 
                            The csv file was not needed in the end.

                        <p>The back-end code started with app.js in the db folder. It's main purpose was to 
                            get the data I written in Notepad into the database. The commented out lines show the 
                            process of the guide I followed to make this all work. From creating a table, reading it, 
                            inserting data in it, etc. With the help of ChatGPT I was able to fix the problems I had 
                            with the code. To things I was missing from importing or mistakes I wrote in the code. To make it work 
                            you would need to run "node app.js" in the terminal, which will open a localhost that runs the index 
                            page of this project along with the database.</p>
                        <p>The other JavaScript files in the script folder, work around the database and make thought of features work. 
                            The file names give out their purpose. Shoeguide.js makes the shoe guide page work correctly by filtering out the shoes 
                            to present the shoes that the user is looking for with the chosen specifics. The shoppingcart.js remembers the user's picked 
                            shoes to then display them in the shopping cart page with price and quantity. The admin.js is another one of the ideas that 
                            were left out due to time crunch. It was supposed to be a page where Monk, and only them, can add new shoes to the database.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>This sprint I worked with Lucas. It felt like I have been working with only him this entire semester 
                        already after the branding project, so I wasnâ€™t bothered. One thing I can say for sure is that working 
                        fully on the back-end side of the website was tougher than I thought. The challenge was to work with 
                        node and sqlite3 for the database holding all the data I wrote. The results were all satisfying to me. 
                        Getting mostly thumbs up for the media campaign and development of the Monkshop by Monk themselves was 
                        a good way to end both sprints. What I learned from this is that having a database setup can be 
                        very handy, especially for the goals of this project.</p>
