                            <p>The project started with a good amount of research methods with the purpose
                                 to get a better understanding on what we should do. This is the project 
                                 plan made to summarize the work that was done before the first presentation 
                                 with Monk. I have structured the document and the content was made by me and 
                                 the group. I will explain more on the work I did from all of this.</p>

                            <h4>Brainstorming/Mind Mapping</h4>
                            <p>The brainstorming process began with a verbal brainstorming session where me 
                                and the other group members shared and discussed ideas. Though it got us a 
                                start in sparking some idea, it lacked a structure and did not get us far. 
                                To have a proper brainstorming method going that would get us far, I proposed 
                                going with the mind mapping method. The template for the mind mapping method 
                                was taken online but the content was all me and my group. The map was centered 
                                around the question of “How do we get people to go to the Monkshop”, and from 
                                there developed themes.<br>
                                For the poster theme I helped in bringing the chalk 
                                handprints concept, where the chalk handprints reference the climbing part of 
                                bouldering and was something that would catch the eye of bystanders to then 
                                follow the handprint trail to the poster.<br>
                                For the flyer theme, this was one of the less inspired type of concept that involves 
                                flyers. It wasn't just a flyer that is handed at a train station or in a city where 
                                everyone else is walking by. The idea I had for this was that the flyers would be 
                                placed on a stand that is near any bouldering hotspots. Having a flyer stand in the 
                                outdoors is very out of place and I thought of it of a good way to get people curious 
                                enough to walk by and pick a flyer which would contain information on what you would 
                                need for outdoor climbing and encouragement to head over to the Monkshop.<br>
                                For the commercial theme I had this strange idea to have some sort of mascot that could 
                                be used for commercial purposes and something to add to Monk's branding. This was a 
                                throw-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks idea which I thought of a superhero-like mascot 
                                that represents the Monkshop. It was thought out after a lesson in looking at succesful 
                                campaigns via commercials and I thought back to mascots that make it work like the Geico 
                                gecko or the Michelin Man. A storyboard was partially made with the mascot in mind but was 
                                then left uncomplete as the idea is not something we will pitch to Monk.<br>
                                The customer engagement theme ideas were all brought onto the mind map by me. The idea 
                                for the Demo Days was Monk hosting an event near an outdoor climbing hotspot with the purpose of 
                                having people come over and test their gear, to boost the confidence in the products Monkshop offers, 
                                which would lead in potential customers heading over to the Monkshop to purchase the gear after testing them. 
                                The QR scavenger hunt idea was to have QR codes hanging near outdoor climbing hotspots which people can engage 
                                in scanning them to recieve discounts for Monkshop's products.

                            <p>There was some problems on how to start with the outdoor climbing pillar theme me and my team got to focus on for this 
                                project so I and sent an email to Bob from Monkshop to get better insight on how outdoor climbing goes with the 
                                process and important gear, potential hotspots in the Netherlands that my group and I could go for observation and 
                                a brandguide so any mockup me and my group creates that fit the color scheme and font of Monk and what we need to do
                                in order to check inside the Monk bouldergym in Eindhoven for some observation on the shop and bouldering zone.<br>
                                The insight gotten from this was that Eindhoven, the Netherlands in general, has no real hotspot for any outdoor 
                                bouldering, which limits me any my group in an observation research on outdoor climbing. Also getting an idea of the 
                                guidebook, the TOPO's, as there was an idea before on doing a concept on the guidebook's themselves. As for the brandguide, 
                                some sort of document or anything else that we can use as Monk's brandguide for our mockups was never recieved.

                            <h4>Built For You Message</h4>
                            <p>After the presentation with Monk with showing the work me and my group had so far, we got feedback that was used 
                                to make some changes on everything we had. Firstly, the target audience is now aimed at Monk's already existing customers 
                                instead of focusing on potential new ones. The poster concept would needed to align now with the Built For You message and 
                                ditch the chalk handprint idea as Monk thought it would cause danger to their climbers who are busy with their activity or 
                                anyone else who tries to reach high and see the posters. The QR scavenger concept would be ditched entirely as it was looked 
                                at as more of a marketing stunt than a longterm media campaign. I'll have here the overall document regarding the Built For You 
                                message, which I helped in structuring, and the work I have done explained further ahead.

                            <p>The work I have was the continuation on the Demo Days concept, as it was the one of the concepts that Monk liked during 
                                the first presentation with them, and is worded to focus more on the target audience of Monk's current customers. The 
                                continuation came from the flyers I created that is centered around advertising the Demo Days event. There is also work on 
                                the existing webshop that I worked on. Both the flyer and webshop work is better explained in Learning Outcome 3.

                            <h4>Demo Days Flyers</h4>
                            <p>The Demo Days flyers are for the purpose of advertising the event to Monk's customers who come to the bouldergym and 
                                that could also be posted on any of Monk's social media platforms. The color scheme is the simple black and white colors that 
                                Monk sticks with in their website. An image that depicts what the event will be, with the shape of the image to look like one 
                                of the wall grips that climbers hold onto when climbing, and clear text to let people know when and where it 
                                will be as an example.<br>
                                The second iteration was done after feedback on the first flyer being too "playful" and to have one more "rough" for Monk's 
                                standards. So the second poster has the image in shape of what could be a boulder outside, with the image giving a clear idea 
                                on what the event will be, and the text having keywords that catch the attention of readers. The keywords should also give a clear 
                                understanding that the event will have something to do with free outdoor gear, while also adding the Built For You tagline in there 
                                for consitency. The yellow color did not really have a deep meaning to it, it was just the color I picked that highlights keywords and 
                                differs from the same black and white color to boost the yellow color on catching the attention of readers.

                            <h4>Webshop Concept</h4>
                            <p>The feedback recieved on the overall work of the Built For You document, before it was altered to it's current version, 
                                there was an input on how this message will fit the webshop. I then went on Figma to go along with this idea on changing some parts 
                                of Monkshop's existing pages to see how the message can fit. The Built For You message works so the You can be changed with other words 
                                while still conveying the same message. The idea I had was to show this with all the products by having the main Built For You message 
                                be displayed at the navigation bar where users will browse for different products, to then changing the You part with another word that fits 
                                different products(Footwear is Built For Heights, Outdoors is Built For Nature, etc). Feedback from this was to make the message of 
                                the products being Built For You more concrete. So from here I worked on the pages when a product category is chosen. This will bring 
                                the user to the page where it will give a description of the products to really make the customer more sure that the message is clear. 
                                The climbing shoes are built for heights. Why? Here is the description with highlighted words to make it more clear. The shoes have 
                                an adaptive fit, they are durable, they are Built For Endurance. Words that catches the eye with the yellow color and also 
                                shout out why they are built for heights.

                            <p>As shown in Learning Outcome 1, I conducted the interview with Bob from Monkshop with questions me and group had for outdoor climbing. 
                                It was advised to begin with this as we really had no idea how the outdoor climbing works and because Monk made it clear on not to 
                                do a survey or anything of that sort with climbers because it's a disturbance. The reason for asking a brandguide was so it would be more 
                                professional if the mockups made were fully consistent with Monk's brand identity. Though I never got any kind of brand guide, at least the 
                                previous questions were answered. There was a first idea to do something with a guidebook for climbers but after the interview the idea 
                                on a guidebook concept was scrapped.

                                This was for the purpose of observation and trying to squeeze any other topics we have to add to the map of ideas. Even from 
                                Looking around while walking there to see any kind of inspiration for a concept. We looked around the climbiing area and the shop 
                                the bouldergym had. Our topic was for outdoor climbing but we wanted to see everything in the gym to think of anything that can also fit with outdoor 
                                bouldering which could also extend with indoor bouldering. Looking at the shop too to see the essential gear that climbers would need for climbing 
                                and taking a look in the guidebook's they had to see if the guidebook concept idea can work. There wasn't much that was thought out after observing the 
                                bouldergym but it was clear that the guidebook concept would be scrapped. It is a shame that there are no climbing spots in the Netherlands but 
                                at least we got something out of looking around at the bouldergym.

                            <p>Throughout the project we asked/recieved feedback to better our progression. Starting off after showing the mind map and what we can do after that, 
                                which is to combine 3 ideas from there into one concept for the first presentation. Going with the TikTok, posters and customer engagement ideas as 
                                the flyers and commercials felt too uninspired. After that we got the feedback we needed from Monk themselves after the presentation where they let us 
                                know what they liked and what they didn't. Having to change the target audience from new potential customers to current Monk costumers and changing some ideas 
                                like the posters and scrapping the QR scavenger hunt for being more like a marketing stunt. The next step was to think of a tagline which would be the 
                                message we want Monk's customers to feel when going to the Monkshop. This is where the Built For Nature was introduced and with further input it has 
                                been changed to Built For X (where X could be different words) to then Built For You to sum up every other word into one. It's Built For Nature, Built For 
                                Heights but most importantly, it is Built For You. From here on then it proceeded with the mockups to have that message in to keep everything consitent. 
                                Although most of the feedpulse feedbacks were filled in by me, it was me and another group member who wrote down the feedpulse checkpoints together and 
                                ask for feedback when we needed it most.

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>I thought this project went way better than the branding project. The only trouble was after the first presentation with Monk when the group and I were 
                                a little lost on what the next step should be and the overall group engagement that died down slightly. However that didn't stop everything as a whole lot was done 
                                as a group and I am very satisfied with what we had to show for the final presentation. I feel like more of a leader, or co-leader, during this project 
                                for really getting it clear on what everyone is doing and what should be done. I wish i could have done more with the mockups to show more Learning 
                                Outcome 3 proof. A group member was already tasked with a lot of it with the posters and a video so I wanted to have the flyers made for the Demo Days advertisement 
                                and the webshop concept but still felt I am lacking in showing what I can do for that Learning Outcome. If anything I will have to step infront on any Learning Outomce 3 
                                work I can do for the next sprint.
