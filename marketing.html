                            <p>The project started with a good amount of research methods with the purpose
                                 to get a better understanding on what we should do. This is the project 
                                 plan made to summarize the work that was done before the first presentation 
                                 with Monk. I have structured the document and the content was made by me and 
                                 the group. I will explain more on the work I did from all of this.</p>

                            <h4>Brainstorming/Mind Mapping</h4>
                            <p>The brainstorming process began with a verbal brainstorming session where me 
                                and the other group members shared and discussed ideas. Though it got us a 
                                start in sparking some idea, it lacked a structure and did not get us far. 
                                To have a proper brainstorming method going that would get us far, I proposed 
                                going with the mind mapping method. The template for the mind mapping method 
                                was taken online but the content was all me and my group. The map was centered 
                                around the question of “How do we get people to go to the Monkshop”, and from 
                                there developed themes.<br>
                                For the poster theme I helped in bringing the chalk 
                                handprints concept, where the chalk handprints reference the climbing part of 
                                bouldering and was something that would catch the eye of bystanders to then 
                                follow the handprint trail to the poster.<br>
                                For the flyer theme, this was one of the less inspired type of concept that involves 
                                flyers. It wasn't just a flyer that is handed at a train station or in a city where 
                                everyone else is walking by. The idea I had for this was that the flyers would be 
                                placed on a stand that is near any bouldering hotspots. Having a flyer stand in the 
                                outdoors is very out of place and I thought of it of a good way to get people curious 
                                enough to walk by and pick a flyer which would contain information on what you would 
                                need for outdoor climbing and encouragement to head over to the Monkshop.<br>
                                For the commercial theme I had this strange idea to have some sort of mascot that could 
                                be used for commercial purposes and something to add to Monk's branding. This was a 
                                throw-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks idea which I thought of a superhero-like mascot 
                                that represents the Monkshop. It was thought out after a lesson in looking at succesful 
                                campaigns via commercials and I thought back to mascots that make it work like the Geico 
                                gecko or the Michelin Man. A storyboard was partially made with the mascot in mind but was 
                                then left uncomplete as the idea is not something we will pitch to Monk.<br>
