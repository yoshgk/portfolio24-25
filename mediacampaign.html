                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The project started with a good amount of research methods with the purpose to get a better understanding on what we should do. This is the project plan made to
                         summarize the work that was done before the first presentation with Monk. I have structured the document and the content was made by me and the group. 
                         I will explain more on the work I did from all of this.</p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>The project started with brainstorming as me and my group did not really know when to start. We had a lot of ideas but we did not know what to do with them which is 
                        where the <span class="clickable-word" data-target="mindmap-content">mind mapping</span> method comes in. Even with so many ideas, I needed to contact Monkshop themselves with
                        an <span class="clickable-word" data-target="email-interview-content">email interview</span> to get better insight on what they wanted as the first presentation was not so clear on what they wanted.

                    <div class="text">
                        <p> The brainstorming process began with a verbal brainstorming session where me and the other group members shared and discussed ideas. Though it got us a start
                             in sparking some idea, it lacked a structure and did not get us far. To have a proper brainstorming method going that would get us far, I proposed going with
                              the mind mapping method. The template for the mind mapping method was taken online but the content was all me and my group. The map was centered around the question 
                              of “How do we get people to go to the Monkshop”, and from there developed themes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the poster theme I helped in bringing the chalk handprints concept, where the chalk handprints reference the climbing part of bouldering and was something that would 
                            catch the eye of bystanders to then follow the handprint trail to the poster.For the flyer theme, this was one of the less inspired type of concept that involves flyers. 
                            It wasn't just a flyer that is handed at a train station or in a city where everyone else is walking by. The idea I had for this was that the flyers would be placed on a 
                            stand that is near any bouldering hotspots. Having a flyer stand in the outdoors is very out of place and I thought of it of a good way to get people curious enough to 
                            walk by and pick a flyer which would contain information on what you would need for outdoor climbing and encouragement to head over to the Monkshop.
                        </p>
                        <p>For the commercial theme I had this strange idea to have some sort of mascot that could be used for commercial purposes and something to add to Monk's branding. This was a 
                            throw-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks idea which I thought of a superhero-like mascot that represents the Monkshop. It was thought out after a lesson in looking at succesful 
                            campaigns via commercials and I thought back to mascots that make it work like the Geico gecko or the Michelin Man. A storyboard was partially made with the mascot in mind but 
                            was then left uncomplete as the idea is not something we will pitch to Monk.</p>
                        <p>The customer engagement theme ideas were all brought onto the mind map by me. The idea for the Demo Days was Monk hosting an event near an outdoor climbing hotspot 
                            with the purpose of having people come over and test their gear, to boost the confidence in the products Monkshop offers, which would lead in potential customers 
                            heading over to the Monkshop to purchase the gear after testing them. The QR scavenger hunt idea was to have QR codes hanging near outdoor climbing hotspots which 
                            people can engage in scanning them to recieve discounts for Monkshop's products.</p>

                            There was some problems on how to start with the outdoor climbing pillar theme me and my team got to focus on for this project so I and sent an email to Bob 
                            from Monkshop to get better insight on how outdoor climbing goes with the process and important gear, potential hotspots in the Netherlands that my group and I 
                            could go for observation and a brandguide so any mockup me and my group creates that fit the color scheme and font of Monk and what we need to do in order to check 
                            inside the Monk bouldergym in Eindhoven for some observation on the shop and bouldering zone. The insight gotten from this was that Eindhoven, the Netherlands in general, 
                            has no real hotspot for any outdoor bouldering, which limits me any my group in an observation research on outdoor climbing. Also getting an idea of the guidebook, the TOPO's, 
                            as there was an idea before on doing a concept on the guidebook's themselves. As for the brandguide, some sort of document or anything else that we can use as Monk's brandguide 
                            for our mockups was never recieved.

                    <p>After the presentation me and my group had with Monkshop, we had better somewhat a better insight on what we should do. Switching target audience of potential new members for the 
                        bouldergym to the current members of the bouldergym, we had to come up with a new concept that would engage the current members of the bouldergym. The next step was to create a slogan 
                        for the campaign. Built for nature was one of the slogans that was brought up with verbal brainstorming which we then stuck with and after further feedback, it was changed to 
                        <span class="clickable-word" data-target="built-for-you-content">Built For You</span>. To show how this slogan would be used in other ways, I then made Figma prototypes of the 
                        <span class="clickable-word" data-target="webshop-content">webshop.</span>

                            The "Built For You" slogan tells the message of MonkShop’s commitment to providing climbers with high-quality, 
                            purpose-built gear designed specifically for outdoor bouldering adventures. It captures the personalized connection between the gear and the climbers who use it, 
                            emphasizing that each product is thoughtfully crafted to meet the unique demands of outdoor climbing environments. This message highlights MonkShop’s expertise in 
                            the field and assures customers that they are equipped with reliable, durable gear tailored to their needs.

                        <p>
                            A key element of the campaign is the demo days 
                            concept, where Monk hosts free outdoor events in renowned bouldering hotspots like Fontainebleau. These events allow participants to test MonkShop gear in real climbing 
                            conditions, providing an authentic experience of its performance and durability. Attendees also receive expert advice tailored to their climbing goals, further 
                            underscoring MonkShop’s role as a trusted partner for climbers transitioning to outdoor bouldering. Which is why I made two different posterd for the Demo Days event, with the first one 
                            being the more playful kind of poster with the image in the shape of a bouldering wall hold and after feedback, the second poster was made with a more serious, rougher tone to it.

                            The webshop prototypes were made to show how the slogan "Built For You" would be used in other ways. The idea was to have the YOU part change to another word that fits 
                            with the item its being hovered on while still aligning with the message of the slogan. After feedback, the idea was broaden to have detailed desctiption of the item 
                            that was clicked so customers have more confidence in what they are purchasing. You cannot just give a message on that our products work with giving a good explanation why.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>I thought this project went way better than the branding project. The only trouble was after the first presentation with Monk when the group and I were 
                        a little lost on what the next step should be and the overall group engagement that died down slightly. However that didn't stop everything as a whole lot was done 
                        as a group and I am very satisfied with what we had to show for the final presentation. I feel like more of a leader, or co-leader, during this project 
                        for really getting it clear on what everyone is doing and what should be done. I wish i could have done more with the mockups to show more Learning 
                        Outcome 3 proof. A group member was already tasked with a lot of it with the posters and a video so I wanted to have the flyers made for the Demo Days advertisement 
                        and the webshop concept but still felt I am lacking in showing what I can do for that Learning Outcome. If anything I will have to step infront on any Learning Outomce 3 
                        work I can do for the next sprint.
