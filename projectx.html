                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Project X, aka the passion project, was the sprint where I can think of anything to do. This was my chance to 
                        dip my toe in the water of game development. I wanted to create a game. Simple as that. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>Tp start off this sprint, I wrote my project plan. In it where I describe what I wanted to do and how 
                        I would have to do it. After some input on toning down the scope, I went on to designing <span class="clickable-word" data-target="slimeo-content">my character</span>. 
                    A simple design with minimal effort in rigging. I went in Blender to start modeling my character. After my character, 
                I went on to make the <span class="clickable-word" data-target="stage-content">game stage</span>. Again in Blender, to create both assets to which I need to import in Unreal Engine 
            To get the real headache going</p>
                </div>
                <div id="slimeo-content" class="project-txt-and-img">
                    <div class="images">

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>I went to make a few sketches of this character. I wanted a slime/blob creature that was easy to 
                            create in Blender. Slime-o Jones was born. It's a silly name like other video game characters 
                            like Earthworm Jim or Wild Woody. 
                        </p>
                        <p>It took some time but the hardest part of this was really the slime material for the body. Playing around 
                            with the transparency would make the model too noisy but It would have to do for the creatiop 
                            of Slime-o Jones. With a backwards cap and sunglasses, I finished the materials of the model and then 
                            added armature bones to the model for rigging. 
                        </p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>I wanted a small stage that was shaped like a snake. A stage that isn't just a big boring 
                            square. I wanted to make it interesting. I made a drawing in paint and then went on to Blender 
                            to create the stage. It was supposed to be shaped like a snake. So the user can move around the game 
                            in a somewhat interesting way. With a start and finish point indicated by the letters. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The stage I made in Blender had more to it than the reference. It still keeps the snake shape I was going for 
                            but I added some more details to make it more interesting. I added platforms to jump on. With added collision to the model so 
                            the importing in Unreal Engine would be easier. 
                        </p>

                    <p>Importing in <span class="clickable-word" data-target="unreal-content">Unreal Engine</span> was a challenge. When importing models from Blender, there are so many 
                        checkboxes to see which should be checked or not. Unreal Engine itself had way more. After importing 
                        the character and stage, I went on to learn how Unreal Engine works. In the end I got my character 
                        running and jumping around. On January 17th I hope to showcase a playable demo even if it's outside the scope.

                        <p>Learning Unreal Engine in the shortest time span possible was hell. I don't think I could say I learned anything. 
                            There is still so much I don't know about. Also importing the work from Blender was a challenge. 
                            Again, with so many checkboxes to see which should be checked or not, some things were not imported properly. 
                            The stage itself was missing a few meshes, and Slime-o Jones was his slime material body and some of his glasses. 
                        </p>
                        <p>With the armature also not present, I went along to learn how to rig in Unreal Engine. It was a challenge 
                            but I got it working. I got Slime-o Jones running and jumping around. I should add some animations for him 
                            as he has the skeleton to do so. There are collision issues with the stage, which is not as bad right now 
                            but hopefully by January 17th, I can get it fixed for the showcase. If not, then I have my scope done with a 
                            working prototype of a game.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>The main issue I had here was that I was in Aruba at the time most of the work needed to be done. Working with Blender 
                        on my laptop just sucks and I am glad I am back home to work on it on my pc. Other than that, I did a fast job with the Blender 
                        work of the stage and Slime-o Jones. I could have done better with the stage. I could have added more details to it. And I Still 
                        don't think I really dipped my toe in the waters of game development. just a skin cell.
